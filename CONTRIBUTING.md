## Development Workflow

1. Ensure you have the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch-name`
3. Make your changes.
4. Run the formatter: `deno task format`
5. Check types: `deno task check-types`
6. Run tests: `deno task test`
7. Build the project: `deno task build`
8. If you've made version changes, update the version: `deno task update-version`
9. Commit your changes (preferably using BBai to generate the commit message).
10. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

### Important Tasks
