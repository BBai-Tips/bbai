# LLM Tools

This directory contains the implementation of various tools that can be used by the Language Model (LLM) in the BBai project. These tools provide specific functionalities that enhance the capabilities of the LLM, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks within the project.

## Purpose

The tools in this directory serve the following purposes:

1. Extend the LLM's capabilities by providing access to external resources and functionalities.
2. Enable the LLM to perform specific actions on the project, such as file manipulation, code analysis, and data retrieval.
3. Standardize the interface for different types of tools, making it easier to add new tools in the future.

## Tool Structure

Each tool in this directory follows a consistent structure:

- Implements the `LLMTool` interface.
- Provides a `runTool` method that performs the tool's specific functionality.
- Includes proper error handling and input validation.
- Has corresponding test files in the `tests/` directory within each tool's directory.

## Adding New Tools

When adding new tools to this directory:

1. Create a new directory with the naming convention `[toolName].tool`.
2. Implement the `LLMTool` interface in a `tool.ts` file within the new directory.
3. The tool will be dynamically loaded by the `LLMToolManager` at runtime, so there's no need to add it directly to the tool manager.
4. Create corresponding test files in the `tests/` directory within the tool's directory.
5. Update the documentation to reflect the new tool's functionality.

## Testing

All tools in this directory should have comprehensive test coverage. Tests for these tools are located in the `tests/` directory within each tool's directory.

For more information on testing, refer to the `TESTING.md` file in the project's root directory.

## Maintenance

Regularly review and update the tools in this directory to ensure they remain compatible with the latest project requirements and LLM capabilities. Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes or additions to the tools.
