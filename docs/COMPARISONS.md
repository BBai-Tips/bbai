# Technology Comparisons and Decisions

## API Framework

Comparison of API Frameworks:
1. Oak:
   - Lightweight and performant
   - Inspired by Koa (Node.js framework)
   - Extensive middleware support
   - Active development and community support
   - Good documentation

2. Opine:
   - Express-like API, familiar to Node.js developers
   - Middleware support
   - Less active development compared to Oak
   - Smaller community

3. Abc:
   - Simple and minimalistic
   - Inspired by Echo (Go framework)
   - Limited middleware support
   - Smaller community and less active development

Decision: Oak is chosen for its performance, active development, and extensive middleware support, which aligns well with our project requirements.

## Vector Database

Vector Database options comparison:
1. Hnswlib-ts:
   - TypeScript port of Hnswlib
   - Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
   - In-memory storage, suitable for local use
   - No external database dependencies

2. Faiss:
   - Developed by Facebook AI Research
   - Efficient similarity search and clustering
   - Requires compilation, which may complicate deployment

3. Annoy:
   - Developed by Spotify
   - Approximate nearest neighbors
   - Good for read-heavy workloads
   - Requires compilation, which may complicate deployment

4. Custom implementation:
   - Tailored to project needs
   - Full control over implementation
   - Requires more development time

Decision: Hnswlib-ts is chosen for its efficiency, TypeScript support, and suitability for in-memory local use, aligning with our project requirements.

## CLI Command-line Parsing

CLI Command-line Parsing library recommendation:
1. Cliffy:
   - Comprehensive command-line framework for Deno
   - Rich feature set including command parsing, prompts, and tables
   - Well-documented and actively maintained
   - Modular design allows using only needed components

2. flags:
   - Part of Deno standard library
   - Simple and lightweight
   - Limited features compared to Cliffy

3. yargs:
   - Popular in Node.js ecosystem
   - Ported to Deno, but may have compatibility issues

Decision: Cliffy is recommended for its comprehensive feature set, ease of use, and active maintenance, which aligns well with our project requirements.

## Documentation Generator

Documentation Generator options for Deno projects:
1. TypeDoc:
   - Generates documentation from TypeScript source code
   - Supports Deno projects
   - Produces clean, readable HTML output
   - Active development and community support

2. Deno Doc:
   - Official Deno documentation generator
   - Generates JSON output, which can be used to create custom documentation sites
   - Requires additional tooling to generate user-friendly documentation

3. JSDoc with custom template:
   - Use JSDoc comments and create a custom template for Deno
   - Flexible but requires more setup and maintenance

Decision: TypeDoc is chosen for its TypeScript support, clean output, and active development, which aligns well with our project requirements.
