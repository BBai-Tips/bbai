# Tool Use and Tool Results Structure

## Tool Input

The `inputSchema` defines the structure of "tool use". The schema is the input provided by the LLM when running a tool. It's passed to `runTool` as `toolUse`. It's passed to `formatToolUse` as `toolInput`. The 'tool use' data received from the LLM will always be validated against `inputSchema`. 

## Tool Results

This is the output from running the tool. There are three data components:

- `toolResults` - the data produced from the tool run, that is fed back to the LLM for further handling.
- `toolResponse` [optional] - the textual response describing the results of the tool run
- `bbaiResponse` - the textual response describing what BBai has done while running the tool. 

The `toolResults` are given back to the LLM for further handling, as well as passed to the `formatToolResult` method for display to the user in the current conversation. The `toolResults` need to be suitable for adding to conversation message (eg. `LLMToolRunResultContent`). 

Returning a string is most common; the string can be serialised data such as JSON or XML. Return `LLMMessageContentParts` array if there are multiple components that should be passed to the LLM separately, eg if the `inputSchema` provided an array of operations for the tool run. Return `LLMMessageContentPart` if the content part is 'complex' such as an image block. 

The `toolResults` get passed to `addMessageForToolResult` which will handle converting a string to standard message format suitable for the LLM. If `toolResults` are single `LLMMessageContentPart` or `LLMMessageContentParts` array, they will be added directly. 

The `toolResponse` is optional. It is for providing the LLM with info/metadata about the tool run, if the `toolResults` data needs further explanation. The `toolResponse` is included in the prompt/statement that is returned to the LLM as part of the tool_results messages. 

The `bbaiResponse` is for providing the user with info/metadata about the tool run. It is added to the conversation via `conversationLogger`. 


## Conversation Logger vs LLM Message History

The conversation logs are for displaying by BBai to the user. The LLM message history is the array of messages sent to the LLM with each conversation turn. There is a tight correlation between the two, but they are not the exact same thing. 

For example, the conversation history can have "side" conversations when asking for git commit message, or asking for conversation title, or when delegating tasks such as summarizing a conversation. The conversation logs contain "entries" which can come from multiple LLM interactions.
