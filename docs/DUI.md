# BBai Desktop User Interface (DUI) Documentation

## Overview

The Desktop User Interface (DUI) for BBai is a planned feature that will provide a native application experience for interacting with the BBai system across multiple platforms. This document outlines the preliminary plans, potential features, and considerations for the future development of the DUI.

## Planned Features

- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Native UI elements for each supported platform
- Offline capabilities with local data synchronization
- Integrated terminal for CLI-like interactions
- Advanced code and text editing features
- Visual diff and merge tools
- Project management and file system integration
- Customizable workspace layouts

## Potential Technologies

- Electron: For cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies
- Tauri: A lighter alternative to Electron, using native webviews
- Qt: For native, high-performance applications across platforms
- .NET MAUI: For cross-platform development with C# (primarily for Windows and macOS)

## Development Considerations

1. Choose a technology stack that balances cross-platform compatibility, performance, and development efficiency
2. Design a modular architecture to share code between BUI and DUI where possible
3. Implement platform-specific features and optimizations where necessary
4. Ensure a consistent user experience across different operating systems while respecting platform-specific design guidelines
5. Plan for efficient updates and distribution mechanisms
6. Implement robust error handling and crash reporting
7. Consider security implications of a desktop application, especially regarding file system access and execution of commands

## Getting Started (Future)

[To be determined based on the chosen technology stack]

## Building and Deployment (Future)

[To be determined based on the chosen technology stack and target platforms]

## Contributing

While the DUI is still in the planning phase, we welcome ideas and suggestions. Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for general contribution guidelines and the interface-specific guidelines for DUI development.

## Roadmap

1. Finalize technology stack selection
2. Create proof-of-concept application
3. Develop core features (project management, editing, API integration)
4. Implement platform-specific optimizations
5. Beta testing across different platforms
6. Official release and continuous improvement

This documentation will be updated as the DUI planning and development progresses.
