# BBai Browser User Interface (BUI) Documentation

## Overview

The Browser User Interface (BUI) for BBai provides a web-based interface for interacting with the BBai system. This document outlines the key features, architecture, and development guidelines for the BUI.

## Features (Planned)

- ~~User authentication and session management~~
- Project management and file browsing
- Conversation interface with real-time updates
- Code and text editing capabilities
- File diff viewer and change application
- Integration with BBai API

## Architecture

The BUI is designed as a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the BBai API. Key components include:

- Frontend Framework: [To be decided, e.g., Deno Fresh, or React]
- State Management: [To be decided, e.g., Redux, Vuex, or built-in state management]
- API Communication: RESTful API calls and WebSocket for real-time updates
- Styling: [To be decided, e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS]

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow modern web development best practices
2. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
3. Implement accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
4. Write unit tests for components and integration tests for key user flows
5. Use TypeScript for type safety
6. Follow the BBai project coding conventions

## Getting Started (For Developers)

1. Clone the BBai repository
2. Navigate to the `bui` directory
3. Install dependencies (command to be determined based on the chosen tech stack)
4. Run the development server (command to be determined)

## Building and Deployment

[To be determined based on the chosen tech stack and deployment strategy]

## Contributing

Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for general contribution guidelines and the interface-specific guidelines for BUI development.

## Future Enhancements
