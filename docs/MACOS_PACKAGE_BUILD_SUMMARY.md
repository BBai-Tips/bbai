# macOS Package Build Summary

## Work Completed

1. Updated the bash script (`scripts/build_macos_package.sh`) to create a universal macOS .pkg installer for BBai, supporting both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

2. Modified the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/macos-package.yml`) to build both x86_64 and arm64 versions of the CLI and API.

1. Created a bash script (`scripts/build_macos_package.sh`) to automate the building of a macOS .pkg installer for BBai.

3. The updated script now accomplishes the following:
   - Determines the current version from `version.ts`
   - Creates a dedicated build directory (`build/macos_package`) to keep the repo clean
   - Creates universal binaries for `bbai` and `bbai-api` using `lipo`, combining x86_64 and arm64 versions
   - Places the universal binaries in the appropriate location in the package structure
   - Generates a `distribution.xml` file for the installer
   - Builds a component package using `pkgbuild`
   - Creates the final product package using `productbuild`
   - Includes steps to display package contents and verify the universal binaries

3. Resolved issues with package creation:
   - Fixed problems with file inclusion in the final package
   - Updated the package identifier to `tips.bbai.bbai`
   - Ensured `bbai` and `bbai-api` are correctly included in the final package

6. The script now successfully builds a universal macOS package that includes the BBai executables for both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

## Current State

- The `build_macos_package.sh` script is functional and creates a valid universal macOS installer package supporting both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
- The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to build both x86_64 and arm64 versions of the CLI and API.
- The workflow correctly uploads the universal package as a release asset.

- The package correctly includes the universal `bbai` and `bbai-api` executables in `/usr/local/bin`.
- The universal package is named with the suffix '-universal' for clarity.
- Package signing is prepared but commented out, pending reinstatement of the Apple Developer account.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Architecture Testing**:
   - Test the universal package on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs to ensure proper functionality on both architectures.

2. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the universal binaries on both architectures to ensure there are no significant drawbacks.

1. **Testing**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of the package installation on various macOS versions.
   - Verify that the installed `bbai` and `bbai-api` executables work as expected.

4. **GitHub Actions Verification**:
   - Verify that the updated `.github/workflows/macos-package.yml` file correctly builds and uploads the universal macOS package as a release asset.
   - Ensure the workflow runs successfully on both push events and manual triggers.

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update `INSTALL.md` to include instructions for installing BBai using the macOS package.
   - Modify `README.md` to mention the availability of the macOS installer package.

4. **Package Signing**:
   - Once the Apple Developer account is reinstated, implement and test the package signing step in the script.

5. **Notarization**:
   - Research and implement notarization process for the macOS package to ensure smooth installation on recent macOS versions.

6. **User Guide**:
   - Create a macOS-specific user guide explaining how to install and use BBai with the new package installer.

7. **Version Automation**:
   - Consider automating the version extraction process to ensure it always matches the current project version.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhance the script with more robust error handling and user-friendly error messages.

9. **Cleanup Process**:
   - Review and potentially enhance the cleanup process after package creation.

10. **Integration with Main Release Process**:
    - Once all tests pass, integrate the macOS package building into the main release process of BBai.
