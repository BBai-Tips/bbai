## Be Better at ... Everything You Do with Text

BBai _(pronounced b-b-aye)_ is an advanced AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize how you work with text-based projects. Whether you're coding, writing, or managing complex documentation, BBai is here to help you "be better" at every step.

_(The name is also a respectful nod to [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), my beloved text editor by Bare Bones Software)_


## Why BBai?

In a world where AI assistants are becoming commonplace, BBai stands out by offering a more comprehensive, project-wide approach to content creation and management. Born from the need for a more versatile and powerful tool than existing solutions, BBai brings the full potential of large language models (LLMs) directly to your projects.

### Key Features

- **Web Page Fetching**: The `LLMToolFetchWebPage` allows BBai to retrieve content from web pages, providing additional context and information for the LLM to reference during conversations.
- **Web Page Screenshot**: The `LLMToolFetchWebScreenshot` enables BBai to capture screenshots of web pages, allowing the LLM to analyze visual content when needed.

- **Universal Text Support**: From code to prose, BBai handles it all.
- **Web Page Fetching**: The `FetchWebPageTool` allows BBai to retrieve content from web pages, providing additional context and information for the LLM to reference during conversations.
- **Project-Wide Understanding**: Uses `ctags` for initial project comprehension, with plans for advanced techniques like RAG and embeddings in the future.
- **Intelligent Tools**: Employs LLM tools for clear, purpose-driven interactions.
- **First-Class Project Discussions**: Makes conversations about your project as important as the changes themselves.
- **Multiple Interface Options**: API, Browser User Interface (BUI), Command Line Interface (CLI), and future Desktop User Interface (DUI) for flexible usage.
- **Conversation Management**: Handles multiple conversations simultaneously for complex projects.
