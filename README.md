## Why BBai?

In a world where AI assistants are becoming commonplace, BBai stands out by offering a more comprehensive, project-wide approach to content creation and management. Born from the need for a more versatile and powerful tool than existing solutions, BBai brings the full potential of large language models (LLMs) directly to your projects.

### Key Features

- **Universal Text Support**: From code to prose, BBai handles it all.
- **First-Class Project Discussions**: Makes conversations about your project as important as the changes themselves.
- **Conversation Management**: Handles multiple conversations simultaneously for complex projects.
- **Intelligent Tools**: Employs LLM tools for clear, purpose-driven interactions.
- **Web Page Fetching**: The `FetchWebPage` tool allows BBai to retrieve content from web pages, providing additional context and information for the LLM to reference during conversations.
- **Web Page Screenshot**: The `FetchWebScreenshot` tool enables BBai to capture screenshots of web pages, allowing the LLM to analyze visual content when needed.
- **Project-Wide Understanding**: Uses `ctags` for initial project comprehension, with plans for advanced techniques like RAG and embeddings in the future.
- **Multiple Interface Options**: API, Browser User Interface (BUI), Command Line Interface (CLI), and future Desktop User Interface (DUI) for flexible usage.

## Who Can Benefit from BBai?

BBai is designed for a wide range of professionals working with text, including but not limited to:

- Software Developers
- Technical Writers
- Content Creators
- Fiction Authors
- Data Scientists
- Configuration Managers

## Use Cases

BBai excels in various scenarios:

- **Code Refactoring**: Analyze and improve code across an entire project.
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep your docs in sync with code changes.
- **Content Creation**: Generate and refine written content with AI assistance.
- **Project Analysis**: Get insights and summaries of large codebases or text projects.
- **Learning and Exploration**: Discuss and understand complex projects with an AI assistant.

## How BBai Works

1. **Project Understanding**: BBai uses advanced techniques to comprehend your entire project.
2. **Intelligent Conversations**: Discuss your project, ask questions, and explore ideas with the AI.
3. **Coherent Changes**: Make wide-ranging, consistent updates across your project with ease.
4. **Review and Iterate**: Analyze changes, discuss further improvements, and refine your work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using BBai, ensure you have the following:

1. An Anthropic API key (Note: This is different from your Anthropic chat console login. You'll need to create an API key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (latest stable version, recommended but optional)
3. [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) (optional, enhances project understanding)

Git and ctags can be easily installed using package managers like Homebrew on macOS or apt on Linux. While Git is optional, it's highly recommended for optimal use of BBai.

### Installation

BBai can be installed on various platforms:

- **macOS and Linux**: Use our one-line installation script:
  ```sh
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BBai-Tips/bbai/main/install.sh | sh
  ```

- **Windows**: Download and run the `bbai-installer.msi` from our [Releases page](https://github.com/BBai-Tips/bbai/releases). For detailed instructions, see our [Windows User Guide](docs/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md).

- **Manual Installation**: For advanced users, we provide options to install from release packages or build from source.

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).

After installation, you can start using BBai as follows:

1. Initialize BBai in your project directory:
   ```
   bbai init
   ```
2. Start the BBai API and open the browser interface:
   ```
   bbai start
   ```
3. Or, start the BBai API and use the command-line interface:
   ```
   bbai chat
   ```

On Windows, use `bbai.exe` instead of `bbai`.

## Documentation

For detailed information on how to use BBai, please refer to our documentation:

- [API Documentation](docs/API.md): Explore the BBai API endpoints for integrating BBai into your workflows or building custom tools.
- [BUI Documentation](docs/BUI.md): Learn about the planned Browser User Interface for BBai.
- [CLI Documentation](docs/CLI.md): Understand how to use the BBai Command Line Interface for various operations.
- [DUI Documentation](docs/DUI.md): Explore the future plans for the Desktop User Interface.

These guides provide comprehensive information on BBai's features, usage patterns, and best practices to help you make the most of this powerful tool.

## Why Choose BBai?

- **Holistic Approach**: Unlike auto-complete tools, BBai understands and reasons over your entire project.
- **Versatility**: Works with any text-based project, not just code.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the process of making large-scale, coherent changes.
- **Learning Tool**: Enhances understanding of complex projects through AI-assisted exploration.
- **Future-Proof**: Designed to grow with advancements in AI and LLM technology.

## Roadmap

BBai is continuously evolving. Here's an overview of our planned features and approximate timelines:

1. Short-term (Next 3-6 months):

- Implementation of RAG and embedding capabilities for enhanced project understanding and comprehensive project visibility
- Initial support for additional LLM providers

2. Medium-term (6-12 months):
- Agent Orchestrator: A powerful feature that allows the LLM to break down complex tasks into smaller chunks managed by sub-agents. This enables:
	- Faster and more cost-effective processing for simple tasks using smaller models
	- Reduced context window size and costs for multiple conversations
	- Synchronous task completion for improved overall operation speed
- Expanded tool ecosystem for more specialized tasks

3. Long-term (Beyond 12 months):
- Advanced integration with version control systems
- Collaborative features for team-based projects
- AI-driven project optimization suggestions

Please note that these timelines are approximate and subject to change based on development progress and community feedback.
