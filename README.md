- writing code

- refactoring code
- writing docs
- updating docs
- ...anything you do with text

`bbai` (pronounced b-b-ay) talks with an LLM (currently Claude) to help you "be better". The name is also a nod (with respect) to my favourite editor, [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), made by Bare Bones Software.
